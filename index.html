            </ul>
        
            <h4>Technical Stack & Development</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> The user-facing mobile application is built with Flutter, ensuring a cross-platform experience for both Android and iOS users.</li>

                            <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fake audio is a growing issue across various fields. It includes news media, politics, entertainment, etc. This kind of fake audio can spread false information, manipulate people’s thinking, and even harm someone’s reputation. Reliable detection of fake audio is therefore essential. This can be done by first extracting MFCC features from the audio signal. MFCCs are used to capture the spectral characteristics of audio data. The features are fed into a hybrid model, which includes a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN). The CNN extracts feature from the spatial domain, by identifying spatial patterns within the audio. Meanwhile, the RNN extracts features from the temporal domain, by capturing changes and patterns over time, which is crucial for understanding the temporal aspects of audio data. This method yields accurate results and can be useful in real-world applications including content control, media forensics, and cybersecurity. To make this system more user-friendly, it is made into an application. So that the user would simply need to upload the audio file to the application, and the results would be displayed as either” fake” or” real”, along with a percentage indicating how confident the system is in its decision. This helps to identify if the audio file is manipulated. Such user-friendly tools are essential for safeguarding the integrity of information and protecting individuals from the harmful effects of fake audio.</li>
